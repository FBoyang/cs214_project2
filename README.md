In this assignment, we creatively applied multithread technique to speed up the mergesort and quicksort process. We did large
experimental test to find the balance between multithread overhead and parallel computing benefit. Our algorithms significantly
beat most students' solution and rank top 10 in terms of algorithms running time.
